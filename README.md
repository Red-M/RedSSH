# RedSSH

SSH automation with easy of use and all the options still available.

This is in beta for now, however I wouldn't release something that didn't work properly.
Things might just change unexpectedly.


# Installing

You can install via pip with `pip install redssh` or the latest commit which may not be the most stable, from git with `pip install git://git@bitbucket.org/Red_M/redssh.git`
